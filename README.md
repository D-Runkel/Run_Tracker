# Run_Tracker

I made this application to closely track the amount of miles I have been running, as well as the pace and date of the run. 

Users are able to add, update, and delete runs from a local database within the apps storage

The UI is simple, a bottom navigational bar, Floating action button, RecyclerView and preference screen.

The Primary patterns used for development is the Observer pattern, where a parent activity "Observes" the child activity.

I innovated and did well with the floating action button. The OnClick listener and styles change based on what state the button is in, I was able to use the button for multiple uses,
acting as a primary additive button, and a final confirmation button to save the data with.

I was planning on adding additional features, but I will have to see how I handle the course load for next semester.
